{"name":"snowWhiteNoise","tagline":"An Arduino Due and a PC give you the frequency response of any device, filter or amplifier, up to 100kHz.","body":"If you have got a Black Box and you want to know its frequency response, Snow White Noise is for you. If you want to learn or teach filters, FFT, power spectrum and white noise analysis, Snow White Noise is for you.\r\n\r\nsnowWhiteNoise sends white noise to your black box and then records output of your black box and make a Gain-Frequency graph of you device. You can also have the raw data and do your own analysis on them.\r\n\r\nI wrote this codes to test my home made preamp. I have got the inspiration while attending Hand-on research in complex systems. http://www.handsonresearch.org/\r\n\r\nThis code uses DMA so it is fast and can handle sampling rates up to 200kHz.\r\nI followed @pklaus code to handle buffers and use DMA and ADC.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
